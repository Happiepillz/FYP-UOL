            <Text style={styles.bodyText}>Hello! I am a dedicated student on a mission to help you conquer time management challenges with my Star Stud application. As a student myself, I understand the demands of juggling assignments, exams, and daily life. That's why I've designed Star Stud with the powerful Pomodoro technique at its core. But I didn't stop there â€“ I've gone the extra mile. In addition to enhancing your productivity, my app offers you a glimpse into the day with weather forecasts and provides a harmonious backdrop for your work with a built-in music player. I believe in striking the perfect balance between work and leisure, and Star Stud is my way of helping you do just that.
